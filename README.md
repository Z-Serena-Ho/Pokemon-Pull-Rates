# Pokemon-Pull-Rates
This project is ultimately for fun and is not intended to draw any definitive conclusions on any given set. Please feel free to utilize any of my data or code in this repository. Special thanks to Bulbapedia for providing the card names, set numbers, and images.

The first step in my process is to gather basic info of every card in a given set. Afterwards, an online survey will be conducted to track pull rates for each card. There is the potential issue of illegitimate entries thoguh I will hope nobody skews it on purpose.

Finally, the intention is to publish charts based on the results. For example, seeing the "hit rate" for any given card or rarity.
